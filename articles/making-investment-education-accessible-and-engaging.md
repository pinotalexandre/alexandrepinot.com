Creating an app that users truly connect with goes far beyond just clean design or robust functionality—it’s about engaging users on a deeper level. At Finzy, where we aim to demystify finance and make investment education accessible, we found a valuable ally in the **Octalysis Framework**. This gamification model provided more than a simple checklist of features; it offered a roadmap to tap into human motivation and transform how users experience learning about finance. Here’s why Octalysis matters and how it shaped Finzy’s journey toward meaningful engagement.

## **The core philosophy: motivation-driven design**

At its heart, the **Octalysis framework** is rooted in a powerful idea: **engagement is about motivation, not manipulation**. Many apps try to drive engagement through superficial rewards, like badges or streaks. Octalysis, however, focuses on what makes people tick on a fundamental level. It taps into eight intrinsic motivators—each one a “core drive” that affects human behavior. For us at Finzy, applying these drives meant we could appeal to users’ natural curiosity, sense of progress, and need for purpose, rather than relying on extrinsic motivators alone.

By adopting this philosophy, our goal wasn’t just to make Finzy *fun*; it was to make it *meaningful*. We wanted our users to walk away not just feeling entertained, but empowered and motivated to apply their knowledge about finance in real life.

## **From theory to action: bringing motivation to Finzy’s design**

### **A purpose-driven learning experience**

One of the key motivations for people to stick with something challenging—like learning to invest—is **having a purpose that resonates**. Financial independence or personal empowerment is a deeply meaningful reason to keep users invested. Using Octalysis’ **“Epic Meaning & Calling”** drive, we gave Finzy users a clear narrative: you’re not just learning finance; you’re building a secure future for yourself.

We introduced this purpose right from onboarding, framing Finzy as a tool to navigate life’s financial complexities. By keeping the “why” visible throughout the app, we saw an increase in both sign-ups and sustained engagement, as users felt a stronger commitment to learning something with long-term benefits.

### **Learning as progress, not pressure**

Learning is inherently challenging, and for many, finance is intimidating. We wanted Finzy to feel like an achievable journey, not an overwhelming one. Using Octalysis’ **“Development & Accomplishment”** drive, we structured the app into clear, achievable steps and milestones, allowing users to celebrate small wins along the way.

By breaking down complex financial concepts into bite-sized modules, we gave users a sense of accomplishment without the pressure. Streaks, badges, and short quizzes provided subtle nudges, making each step feel rewarding. For users, Finzy became less about “getting it right” and more about **enjoying the journey of learning**.

### **Ownership over the learning journey**

People are more likely to stay engaged when they feel like they have something to lose. **“Ownership & Possession”** is another Octalysis drive that emphasizes the importance of personal investment in the learning process. For Finzy, we brought this concept to life by giving users a profile that captures their progress, achievements, and personalized lessons.

This wasn’t just a profile—it was a record of their dedication and growth. By allowing users to track their journey, Finzy turned learning into a form of self-expression, giving users a sense of pride in their progress and a reason to come back.

## **Octalysis as a foundation for genuine user engagement**

What makes Octalysis unique is its emphasis on **human-centered design**. Rather than simply adding points or badges, it invites designers to think about how users feel at every interaction. Are they challenged, curious, or maybe even a little unsure? These emotional states matter because they shape whether users stay or leave.

For Finzy, applying Octalysis meant that we weren’t just building a product; we were crafting a story. By embedding motivators into our design, we gave users the ability to explore, discover, and grow at their own pace. This wasn’t about “keeping people hooked”; it was about respecting their journey and providing a platform that made learning both enjoyable and enriching.

## **How Octalysis brings substance to digital engagement**

In the end, the value of Octalysis is in its **depth**. It goes beyond surface-level features to address what makes people return to an app for more than just entertainment. For Finzy, it was a way to create **sustainable engagement**—the kind that isn’t built on quick wins or flashy design, but on a deeper, purpose-driven connection with our users. And for anyone looking to design an app that truly resonates, the Octalysis Framework offers a way to make experiences meaningful, not just memorable.
