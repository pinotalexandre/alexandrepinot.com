## **Designing Finzy:**

### **Introduction**

My experience at Finzy as a Product Designer has been a journey into transforming complex financial concepts into an approachable, user-friendly experience. Finzy’s mission is to make investing as easy and intuitive as learning a new language—something akin to “Duolingo for investing.” Throughout my time working with the team, I focused on creating an experience that educates, motivates, and empowers users to take control of their financial future.

### **Challenge: Designing for Financial Education**

Investment education is inherently challenging; the concepts are often complex, intimidating, and typically presented in ways that feel overwhelming to new investors. The main product design challenge was to strip away the complexity and present content in a digestible, engaging format that could hold the user’s attention over the long term.

**Key Design Goals**:

1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: Make complex financial concepts easy to understand through simplified UI and carefully curated content.
2. **Engagement Through Gamification**: Build features that reward users for their learning journey, encouraging consistent use.
3. **Personalized Learning Paths**: Tailor the user experience to each individual’s goals, helping them feel guided and supported.

### **The Design Process**

The design process for Finzy followed a user-centered approach, integrating feedback loops with user testing to refine our understanding of what works best for our audience.

#### **User Research and Personas**

We started by identifying our core user personas, which included young professionals, university students, and first-time investors. Understanding their goals, pain points, and motivations allowed us to shape Finzy’s features around their needs. Most of our users wanted to learn about investing but didn’t know where to start, felt overwhelmed by technical jargon, or were afraid of making mistakes.

Based on our research, we developed the following user personas:

1. **The Curious Beginner**: Interested in investing but intimidated by complexity.
2. **The Aspiring DIY Investor**: Actively looking to build their own investment portfolio.
3. **The Financially Conscious Planner**: Eager to learn investment basics for long-term planning.

These personas helped us create a roadmap for the product, ensuring every design decision was rooted in the needs of our users.

#### **Defining the Learning Experience**

To make financial concepts digestible, we created “learning paths” – structured content flows that progress from foundational principles to more advanced topics. This approach was inspired by language-learning platforms, where users master one concept before moving on to the next.

**Design Elements**:

* **Interactive Lessons**: Each lesson breaks down investment basics into manageable parts, using visuals, examples, and quizzes to make content stick.
* **Progress Tracking and Rewards**: We implemented progress indicators and achievement badges to motivate users and provide a sense of accomplishment.
* **Personalized Learning Suggestions**: As users complete lessons, Finzy suggests the next steps, helping them build a tailored journey.

### **Key Design Solutions**

1. **Simplified UI for Clarity and Engagement**
   We focused on creating a minimalist UI that emphasized clarity over complexity. I opted for a clean, spacious layout with simple typography, consistent color schemes, and intuitive icons, making navigation easy and content digestible. 

   **Color Scheme**: A calm palette that inspires trust and confidence without feeling overly corporate. 

   **Typography**: Easy-to-read fonts that ensure accessibility across devices.

   The UI design prioritized readability, with carefully spaced elements and digestible information blocks, aiming to reduce cognitive load.
2. **Gamification Elements**
   Inspired by successful ed-tech apps, I introduced gamification to make financial learning more engaging. Users earn points, badges, and streaks for completing lessons, quizzes, and challenges. This feature encourages frequent use and promotes learning through a rewards-based system.

   **Progressive Rewards System**:

   * **Points**: Users earn points for each lesson, incentivizing them to explore more.
   * **Badges**: Unlockable achievements for reaching milestones.
   * **Streaks**: Rewarding users for consistent engagement.

   The gamified elements turned investing into a more enjoyable experience, helping users develop a habit of learning.
3. **Personalized Learning Paths**
   Knowing that financial education isn’t one-size-fits-all, we implemented personalized learning recommendations. As users engage with the app, Finzy tracks their progress and suggests the next best steps tailored to their pace and interest level.

   **Dynamic Content Recommendations**:

   * Tailored suggestions based on completed lessons and quizzes.
   * Targeted prompts to revisit topics or explore new investment concepts.
   * Personalized notifications for relevant, timely content.

   These recommendations helped increase retention, as users felt guided and supported throughout their journey.
4. **Community and Social Features**
   Given the challenges in investing, we recognized the importance of building a support system within Finzy. We developed a community space where users can connect, ask questions, and share experiences. This social component made learning feel less isolating and fostered a supportive environment.

### **Challenges Faced**

Building Finzy was not without its challenges. Here are a few obstacles I encountered as a product designer and how we overcame them:

1. **Complex Content Presentation**

   * **Challenge**: Financial concepts are often dense and filled with jargon.
   * **Solution**: Breaking down each lesson into short, visual segments helped make the content more approachable. We incorporated tooltips and glossaries to explain technical terms directly within the interface.
2. **Maintaining User Engagement Over Time**

   * **Challenge**: Financial learning can feel monotonous, leading to user dropout.
   * **Solution**: By introducing interactive quizzes, bite-sized lessons, and progress tracking, we encouraged a more engaging experience. Users could track their progress, celebrate milestones, and feel a sense of accomplishment.
3. **Designing for Personalization**

   * **Challenge**: Each user’s financial knowledge and goals vary, requiring a personalized approach.
   * **Solution**: Dynamic learning paths adapted to each user’s progress, and our recommendation system offered tailored content, helping users stay engaged with relevant material.

Finzy has been well-received by our target audience, with users praising the simplicity, clarity, and engaging approach to investment education. Key metrics that reflect the impact of our design decisions include:

* **Retention Rate**: Our community features and progress-tracking system have helped us achieve a retention rate of over 65% among active users.
